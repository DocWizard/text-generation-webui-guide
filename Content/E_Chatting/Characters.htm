        <h1>Characters</h1>
        <p>While chatting with your AI&#160;assistant is fun in its own right, you may also wish to breathe some character into your chats. Text-generation-webui offers a <b>character</b> feature, allowing the AI&#160;assistant to play any role you can imagine.</p>
        <p>Load a model, then go to <b>Parameters</b> &gt;&#160;<b>Character</b>. </p>

        </p>
        <p>You will see the default character settings offered by text-generation-webui. You can change any of these settings at will. Try replacing the <b>Your Name</b>&#160;field with your own name, and edit the <b>Context</b> field to your own liking. Afterwards, select the <b>save</b> button and name your new persona. You can also try to chat with the example persona bundled with text-generation-webui. To do this, select 'example' from the drop-down menu.</p>
        <p>To chat with a character, you can go to the <b>Chat </b> menu and select <b>chat-instruct </b> from the <b>chat mode menu</b> on the right. You will see the introductory statement from your chosen character. You can now interact with them:</p>

        </p>
        <p>If you wish to start a new chat, select <b>"New&#160;chat"</b> from the menu on the left. You can also use the same menu to return to past chats, delete a chat, or give a chat a specific name.</p>
