        <h1>Open-weight Models</h1>
        <p>Using open source LLMs allows for a large degree of freedom when it comes to picking an open-weight model that will best suit your needs. Companies like Mistral&#160;AI, Meta or Google have released open-weight models, and the open source community has fine-tuned them to suit a wide variety of needs.</p>
        <p>Note the difference between <i>open source</i> and <i>open weight</i>. The major models released by the big companies are Neural Net Weights (NNWs) - not human-readable source code, but the 'knowledge' that the artificial neural network has learned.</p>
        <div class="caution">
            <p>Caution!</p>
            <p>Many open-weight LLMs and their finetunes are uncensored, i.e. they don't have the safety guardrails that a service like ChatGPT might have, where it'll refuse to generate offensive, not safe for work or otherwise controversial output. Keep this in mind when selecting a model for yourself.</p>
